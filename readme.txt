This is a Euclidean Drum Machine. So far the gui is only working with one of the drums but final release will have it working with all of them.

The purpose of the program is to generate euclidean rhythms. If you havenâ€™t heard the term before, please have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwigqSwYNaQ
